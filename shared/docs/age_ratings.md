# Orchid Age Ratings

Dear Members,

Welcome to our community! Here are some guidelines to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for our younger and older audience:

## 3+ (Children)
- **Be Kind and Respectful**\
Treat others with kindness and respect. Remember, we're here to have fun and make friends!

- **Family-Friendly Content**\
Keep all content and discussions appropriate for young audiences. No explicit language or mature topics, please.

- **Parental Supervision**
We encourage parents or guardians to supervise their children's online activities and discussions within the community.\
[Parental Control](./parental_control.md) could help with that but it's still recommended for parents to supervise.

- **Keep Pride Away from Minors**\
Pride community (LGBTQ+) is related about sexual and explicit content and is strictly forbidden from kids too young to understand to avoid predatory acts.

- **Normalizing Sexualization**\
Normalizing or discussing sexual topics to minors is forbidden and will result in a permament ban.

Notice:
Calling this homophobic, transphobic or else could result in a permament IP ban for using any phobia as a excuse to show minors sexual content. And a probability to be reported as a predator to the authorities. This is Orchid and child safety is taken extremely seriously.

## 13+ (Teens)


Let's build a friendly and inclusive space for members of all backgrounds and interests!

Best regards,
Orchid
